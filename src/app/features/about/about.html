    <h1>About BrakEnKie</h1>

    <p>
      Who are we… Every time I take the Frenchies for a walk on our 5 hectare farm in the
      beautiful landscape in the Cradle of Humankind, I keep wondering to myself, “how does
      the world see us?” Because to me, it’s a big deal that we’re understood.

    <p>
      I wanted to type a long post to explain our daily lives and what makes us different,
      then deleted it and thought these pictures speak so much for those willing to listen.

    <h2>Our Pack</h2>
    <p>
      Ava Grey, Weasley, Chockie, LuLu, Laaitie, Jasmin, Mirabelle, Portia… yup, that’s them.
      They are my pack — my kids, my friends, my family, my Frenchies.

    <h2>Be More DOG</h2>
    <p class="quote">
      A dog is talking to strangers.<br />
      A dog is going outside.<br />
      A dog is seeking the warm spot.<br />
      A dog is surrendering to the chaos.<br />
      A dog is silly grinning.<br />
      A dog is going easy.<br />
      A dog is seeing your best side.<br />
      A dog is loving unconditional every single time…

    <p>
      From my frenchie family to yours.
